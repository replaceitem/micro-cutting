This mod adds recipes to the stonecutter to craft microblocks inside the stonecutter.
By putting a grass block into the stonecutter, you can craft eight playerheads with the grass block texture.

## Configuration

Some things can be configured in the `microcutting.properties` file in the `config` folder.

* `head-count` (Default: `4`) The amount of heads you get for converting one block.
